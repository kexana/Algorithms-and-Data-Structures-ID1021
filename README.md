Repository for the course's lab assignments and reports 

*ID1021 HT24 Algorithms and Data Structures at KTH during ICT bsc*

***

This course covers fundamental programming topics such as algorithm analysis, some basic algorithms (different ways of searching and sorting), rudimentary data structures (lists, stacks, queues, trees), and practical program construction. Emphesis is put on developing the skills to describe, compare, and implement these concepts. The course requires the completion of 9 mandatory assignments and 4 higher-grade assignments. I have chosen to utilise mainly Java. 

In order to present the assigments I was introduced to Latex. All reports are prepared using it and its practical functionalities in structuring text and generating graphs and tables.
